# Legal App Prototype

## Overview
This project is a prototype for a legal application designed to streamline case management and document handling for legal professionals. It demonstrates the use of C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create a modular, maintainable, and scalable application.

## Features
- Secure user authentication
- Comprehensive case and client management
- Advanced search and filtering
- Robust document handling

## OOP Concepts Applied
- **Classes and Objects:** Core entities like `User`, `Case`, `Document`, `Client`, and `Lawyer`.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism:** Base class `Person` with derived classes `Client` and `Lawyer`.
- **Encapsulation:** Private attributes with public getter and setter methods.
- **Abstraction:** Abstract classes and interfaces for complex operations.
- **File Handling:** Persistent storage of data and encryption for security.
